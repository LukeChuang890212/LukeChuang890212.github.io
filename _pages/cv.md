Research Experience
======

**Graduate Research**
*Institute of Statistics and Data Science, NTHU*

* **Ensemble-Based Multiply Robust Methods for Missing Not at Random Data with Model Misspecification** (Spring 2023 - Present)
  * Advisor: Yu-Jen Cheng
  * Paper Manuscript: In preparation
  * Proposed a novel ensemble method for missing not at random data, combining multiple propensity score models with generalized methods of moments to create multiply robust inverse probability weighting estimators, and demonstrated its effectiveness under mild misspecification scenarios through simulation studies and real-world application to mental health data.

**Undergraduate Research**
*Department of Psychology, NCKU*

* **Exploring the Impact of Virtual Reality Training on College Baseball Players' Pitching Performance and Resilience under Different Situational Pressures** (Spring 2021 - Spring 2022)
  * Advisor: Kwang-Yu Cheng (Institute of Physical Education, Health & Leisure Studies, NCKU)
  * Investigated the effect of varying situational pressure levels on the pitching performance of college baseball players using a self-designed virtual reality training system, and explored the potential advantages of virtual reality technology in enhancing players' resilience to pressure-filled situations.
