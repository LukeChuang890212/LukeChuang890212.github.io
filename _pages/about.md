Welcome! I am Ming-Ju (Luke) Chuang, currently working as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Statistics and Data Science, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Taiwan under the supervision of Professor Yu-Jen Cheng.

## Academic Journey

I received my B.S. in Psychology and B.B.A. in Statistics (double major) from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in June 2022, and subsequently earned my M.S. in Statistics and Data Science from NTHU in June 2025. After completing my mandatory military service (July - November 2025), I am currently serving as a Research Assistant (November 2025 - June 2026) before beginning my Ph.D. studies in Statistics at the **University of Michigan, Ann Arbor** in Fall 2026.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **Missing Data Analysis**, **Causal Inference**, and **Meta Analysis**. I am particularly interested in developing robust statistical methods that can handle complex data structures and model misspecification.

## Current Research

I am currently working on "Ensemble-Based Multiply Robust Methods for Missing Not at Random Data with Model Misspecification" under the supervision of Professor Yu-Jen Cheng. This research proposes novel ensemble methods that combine multiple propensity score models with generalized methods of moments to create multiply robust inverse probability weighting estimators.

## Background

My double major in Psychology and Statistics from NCKU provided me with a strong interdisciplinary foundation combining quantitative methods with behavioral science. During my undergraduate years, I conducted research on topics ranging from virtual reality training for baseball players to analyzing factors affecting sports audience behavior, and investigating attentional focus using Systems Factorial Technology. This unique background has shaped my approach to statistical methodology, emphasizing both mathematical rigor and practical applications.

During my graduate studies at NTHU, I served as a Teaching Assistant for courses including Statistical Learning, Survival Analysis, and introductory Statistics, and received multiple scholarships including the Scholarship for Cultivating Outstanding Doctoral Students and Academic Excellence Scholarship.

Beyond statistics, I am passionate about baseball, painting, and learning foreign languages. I have served as the leader of the Softball & Baseball Team at NTHU STAT and enjoy engaging in various extracurricular activities.
