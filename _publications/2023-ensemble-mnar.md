## Abstract

This research proposes a novel ensemble method for handling missing not at random (MNAR) data while accounting for model misspecification. The methodology combines multiple propensity score models with generalized methods of moments to create multiply robust inverse probability weighting estimators. Through extensive simulation studies and real-world application to mental health data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach under mild misspecification scenarios.

## Key Contributions

- Development of multiply robust estimators that combine ensemble methods with GMM
- Robust performance under model misspecification
- Application to mental health data demonstrating practical utility
- Theoretical framework for handling MNAR mechanisms with multiple models
